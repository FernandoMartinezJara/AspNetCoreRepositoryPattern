# AspNetCoreRepositoryPattern

This API — MyMDB (My Movie Database) — provides endpoints that perform CRUD operations on a database of movies and stars. 

It is written in ASP.NET Core using EF Core and SQL Server. 

The development process of the API is explained in [this article](https://medium.com/net-core/repository-pattern-implementation-in-asp-net-core-21e01c6664d7).
The aim of the article is to show the generic repository pattern with asynchronous methods.
